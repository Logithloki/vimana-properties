## Houschka Font Integration

### Current Status
- We've set up the font configuration in the project
- The CSS declarations for Houschka fonts are in place
- Tailwind and layout files have been updated to use Houschka

### Next Steps
1. **Import the Houschka font files**: 
   - You need to place the following Houschka font files in the `public/fonts/houschka/` directory:
     - `Houschka-Light.woff` and `Houschka-Light.woff2`
     - `Houschka-Regular.woff` and `Houschka-Regular.woff2`
     - `Houschka-Medium.woff` and `Houschka-Medium.woff2`
     - `Houschka-Bold.woff` and `Houschka-Bold.woff2`
     - `Houschka-Black.woff` and `Houschka-Black.woff2`

2. **Rebuild the project**:
   - Run `npm run build` to rebuild the project with the new font settings
   - Then run `npm run dev` to test the changes locally

### Acquisition of Houschka Fonts
- Houschka is a premium font that requires licensing
- You'll need to purchase the appropriate license from the font foundry (Carrois Type Design) or use a font service like Adobe Fonts
- Once licensed, download the font files and place them in the directory mentioned above

### Testing
After adding the font files and rebuilding, test the website to ensure:
1. The Houschka font is displaying correctly across all pages
2. All font weights (light, regular, medium, bold, black) are working
3. The typography scales appropriately on different devices

### Fallback
We've configured Arial as a fallback font, which will be used if Houschka fails to load for any reason.
